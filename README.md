# Texto_to_topic
Text-to-Text Topic Generation using Pretrained Language Model

This repository contains code for generating topics from text using pre-trained language models such as GPT-3. The text-to-text approach allows the generation of coherent and diverse topics for any given text input. The code includes data preprocessing, training, and evaluation steps, along with various decoding strategies such as beam search and nucleus sampling. Additionally, the repository includes Jupyter notebooks with examples and visualizations of the generated topics. This code can be used for a variety of applications, including text summarization, chatbots, and content generation.
